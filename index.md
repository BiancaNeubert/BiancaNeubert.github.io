I defended my Phd thesis entitled "Nonparametric inference for convolution models" supervised by  <a href="https://sip.math.uni-heidelberg.de/en/index.html" target="_blank">Jan Johannes</a> and  <a href="https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~comte/" target="_blank">Fabienne Comte</a> on the 4th December 2025.

I am interested in nonparametric inference, inference for inverse problems, adaptive testing and quadratic functional estimation for multiplicative convolution and estimation of convoluted densities.
