I defended my Phd thesis entitled "Nonparametric inference for convolution models" supervised by Jan Johannes and Fabienne Comte on the 4th December 2025.

I am interested in nonparametric inference, inference for inverse problems, adaptive testing and quadratic functional estimation for multiplicative convolution and estimation of convoluted densities.
